# Interactable lists & plates
 
* Completed test task for the company DreamLight (VARDIX GROUP).
* Developing taken 2 days.
* Developed mechanics of interactable plates, which can be moved in lists, sorting them by number & name, storage of list with plates in memory.
* Codebase was followed to SOLID principles, used architecture pattern MVC and Observer for creating modular code.
* Below you can see overview demonstration of work:

# Interactable plates
* Below you can see a behaviour of plates.
* User can drag them, put it in another list or place in another plate position. But if plate element didn't detect another plate or list, it returns to initial position:

# Sorting logic
* There is developed logic of sorting plates by name & number in ascending and descending order.
* Sorting was developed for numbers and names (by alphabetical order):

# Storage logic
* There is developed storage logic, which allows to save all plates in list and then load it:

# Assign name logic
* Easily way to assign name to list via inspector window from Unity and entering in PlayMode:

# Organized hierarchy & prefabs
* All prefabs were created in organized way and splitted.
* For example, main prefab of panel was created as a prefab, but panel with toggles was created as prefab variant:

# Process developing
* During accomplishment, I used Kanban board to set tasks for developing features.
* By it, I simplified completion by small parts:
