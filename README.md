# Interactable lists & plates
 
* Completed test task in the company DreamLight (VARDIX GROUP).
* Developing taken 2 days.
* Developed mechanics of interactable plates, which can be moved in lists, sorting them by number & name, storage of list with plates in memory.
* Codebase was followed to SOLID principles, used architecture pattern MVC and Observer for creating modular code.
* Below you can see overview demonstration of work:

# Interactable plates
* Below you can see a behaviour of plates.
* User can drag them, put it in another list or place in another plate position. But if plate element didn't detect another plate or list, it returns to initial position:

# Sorting logic
* There is developed logic of sorting plates by name & number in ascending and descending order.
* Sorting was developed for numbers and names (by alphabetical order):

* There is developed storage logic, which allows to save all plates in list and then load it:
